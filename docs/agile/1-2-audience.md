> # **1.2** Audience


While this Agile Playbook provides value to all personnel involved in a new agile project startup, the primary audience for this document is 
government project management teams determining how to enable an agile development environment. 
From that perspective, the Agile Playbook seeks to enable the government team for a startup or in-progress project to gain a better 
understanding of the steps necessary to proactively establish the regulatory and process guidelines that are conducive to an agile approach.   
To do this, the agile playbook will focus primarily on providing a better understanding of the following areas and how they enable the success of 
an agile project:

- Contracts 
- Resources 
- Communications
