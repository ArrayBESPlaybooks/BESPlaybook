### Note
To align with industry terminology this Playbook Chapter will use the term “Low-Code” to describe Agile Model-Driven Functionality Improvement development frameworks.  The term “Low-Code” can also be substituted for “No-Code” development frameworks considering the similarities between the two.  Section 3.2 “Low-Code vs. No-Code Frameworks” explains the subtle differences between the two types of platforms.
