> # **1.1** Play 1: Understand how Low-Code can be applied to your project 

We must begin projects considering Low-Code frameworks by exploring the benefits and trade-offs of these software development platforms. It is important to realize that these platforms are not a silver bullet for all software development projects.  This playbook chapter highlights several of the benefits and risks of implementing a Low-Code framework.  Some of the biggest risks with implementing these types of development frameworks is vendor lock-in with limited ability to customize.  The trade-off for accepting the risk of vender lock-in and lack of fine-grained customizations is the ability to empower some end-users known as “Citizen Developers” to rapidly change system functionality to meet their needs based on graphical user interface (GUI) programming tools and the use of pre-determined templates.

### Checklist

- Spend time evaluating the benefits and drawbacks of Low-Code application development frameworks
- Clearly identify the problem you are trying to solve with Low-Code 
- Understand the types of software applications a Low-Code solution is best suited for: Business Process Automation (BPA), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Mobile App Development, Rapid Application Development (RAD), etc.…
- Determine if Low-Code is the right technical solution
- Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible
- Perform Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) using evaluation template in this playbook chapter as a guide
- Document the findings about product evaluation, costs, schedule, risks, and benefits
- Share findings with the team and program leadership

### Key Questions

- Does the Low-Code technology stack meet your technical, functional and programmatic requirements?
- Does the Low-Code platform sufficiently meet requirements with an acceptable level of system customizations required?
- How will you avoid vendor lock-in over the life cycle of the program?
- Who are your primary users, and do they have any specific needs or desires that will or will not be met by a Low-Code solution?
- Are there enough functional SME’s qualified and available to act in the “Citizen Developer” role?
- What level of training will be required for functional SMEs and for end users?
- Which users will have the most difficulty with the system and can that difficulty be mitigated?
- Are there security concerns with this type of system in your environment?
