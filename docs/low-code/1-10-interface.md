> # **1.10** Play 10: Don’t forget the Interfaces

When designing the Low-Code platform solution careful consideration must be made for the required system interfaces.  The selected platform must support open standards and should use internet protocols.  Modern technologies such as Microservices-based architecture help to assure the application’s services are loosely coupled and easily consumable because they utilize “lightweight” internet-based protocols.  When evaluating the Low-Code platforms, determine what interface protocols are supported out-of-the-box and how easily custom interfaces can be developed.

### Checklist

- Know all the required interfaces for your system
- Understand how these interfaces can be accessed
- Understand how the Low-Code platform handles interfaces

### Key Questions

- What interface templates are supported out-of-the-box, e.g. Restful Web Services, SOAP, Microservices, etc.?
- Can you develop custom interfaces if required, and if so, how difficult is this in the selected Low-Code platform?
