> # **1.4** Play 4: Empower the User

One of the biggest benefits to using a Low-Code platform is the ability to rapidly implement changes to the system to meet the needs of its users’.  This can be done by a functional SME acting in the “Citizen Developer” role.  This level of end-user empowerment is necessary to fully realize the benefits of a Low-Code / No-Code platform.  Security must understand that empowering the end-user to make these types of configuration changes will allow the system to be tailored to meet the needs of user community enabling them to better perform their jobs.

### Checklist

- Identify the Functional SME users early in the project
- Work with Security team to define the “Citizen Developer” role and identify any potential concerns
- Develop a plan to incorporate the Functional SME “Citizen Developers” into the design process early

### Key Questions

- Who are your primary users?
- Are there functional SME’s available to act in the “Citizen Developer” role?
