> # **1.5** Play 5: Select a Leader and hold them Accountable

There must be a single product owner who has the authority and responsibility to assign tasks and work elements; make business, product, and technical decisions; and be accountable for the success or failure of the overall system. This product owner is ultimately responsible for how well the system meets the needs of its users and the mission they support.

Please reference the “Agile” Chapter of the BES Playbook for additional information on the Product Owner role in Agile Software Development:
