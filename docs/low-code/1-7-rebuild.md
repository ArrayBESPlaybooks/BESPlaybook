> # **1.7** Play 7: Plan to Rebuild 

If developing a new application this play does not apply.  When modernizing a legacy application with a Low-Code platform, plan to rebuild the app in the selected Low-Code framework.  This will ensure a clean transition to the new technology stack.  In some cases where the legacy application was developed using the Java programming language it may be possible to have the Low-Code platform pull in your applications existing Java classes, but this should be carefully considered during the product evaluation phase.  Given the rapid application development nature of Low-Code platforms rebuilding should be much faster.

Please reference the “Automated Application Modernization” Chapter of the BES Playbook for additional information on Application Modernization methodologies:
