># **2.1** Introduction

In April 2016, Air Force (AF) Logistics (A4) published the "US Air Force Enterprise Logistics Flight Plan v2.0" (ELFP) and a subordinate document titled the "Enterprise Logistics Technology Annex" (ELTA) was published in June 2016.  This plan and annex describe the 2035 future state of AF Enterprise Logistics "synthesized logistics information".  To achieve the longer-term ELFP and ELTA goals, a series of enabling initiatives was defined to achieve necessary foundational near-term milestones.  The "Enterprise Logistics IT (ELIT) Agile Model-Driven Functionality Improvement Playbook Chapter" is one of these initiatives.

Agile Model-Driven Functionality Improvement provides the Air Force (AF) with methods for improving functionality within applications using business process modeling graphical tools that subject matter experts (SMEs) can understand and use.  These models can be used to improve and rapidly extend application functionality using agile process modeling tools.  This is accomplished by creating functional models of the components from existing application code and by creating models for new application components.  Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDP) is the term industry uses to describe these tools & methodologies.  To align with common industry terminology this Playbook Chapter will use the term "Low-Code" to describe Agile Model-Driven Functionality Improvement development frameworks.
