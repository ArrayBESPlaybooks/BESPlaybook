># **2.2** Problem Statement

The AF Logistics portfolio is comprised of many applications that are in a variety of lifecycle stages.  These applications contain critical business rules and process flows used to support AF missions.  They were generally developed using traditional Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) processes based on the sequential Waterfall Software Development methodology. Applications were created using the functional and technical best practices and paradigms available at the time to support requirements but may now be outdated.  This has resulted in a portfolio of applications where maintaining, improving and extending functionality is extremely difficult, costly, resource intensive and requires long schedules.  

Additionally, the AF has a shortage of logistics Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) capable of reinventing AF Logistics processes.  Using traditional AF functional improvement methods, these valuable SMEs spend a lot of time on mundane activities that are not focused on transforming the business in order to improve and rapidly deploy business systems capabilities.
