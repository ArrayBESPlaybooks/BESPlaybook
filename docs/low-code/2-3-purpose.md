># **2.3** Purpose

This Low-Code Playbook Chapter is a continuation of effort by the BES PEO to establish modern practices and methods to accelerate software development and deployment of value for Logistics Information Systems, Business Systems and its end users.  Preceded by playbooks for Agile, Automated Testing, User Experience, and Automated Application Modernization (AAM) this playbook aims to provide approaches, methods, and tools to apply Low-Code development frameworks to digitally transform AF Logistics systems.

The intent of the Low-Code Playbook is to provide a high-level descriptive set of instructions for BES AFLCMC/HIA programs identifying how and what proven agile processes and tools should be used to automate and standardize improvements in logistics systems.  This Playbook will provide HIA with methods for improving functionality within applications using business process modeling management tools that subject matter experts (SMEs) can understand and utilize.  

This Playbook Chapter serves as a “living document,” delivering value in the present while providing a foundation for future updates and enhancements as the state of technology and the needs of stakeholders and end-users served by Logistics Information Systems continually evolve.  This playbook chapter is not intended to replace the standard processes described in the current version of the BES Process Directory (BPD) ([https://www.dau.mil/cop/bes/Pages/Documents.aspx](https://www.dau.mil/cop/bes/Pages/Documents.aspx)) but rather provide additional software development concepts & methodologies that may not be covered in depth within the current version of the BES BPD.  The Low-Code Playbook Chapter, in its current version, serves as a set of best practices that may be used in conjunction with updated BPD content.
