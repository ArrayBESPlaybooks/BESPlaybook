> # **3.4** Low-Code Benefits

The benefits of modern low-code development platforms are:

### Minimal coding, as in user-friendly, visual, drag-and-drop functionality:

- Removal of barriers between Business and IT to support Agile continual collaboration and improvements.
- Minimal necessary upfront investment in setup, configuration, training, and deployment.
- Reduced IT SysOps support, with tools so easy to use that even citizen developers can create apps that integrate into the IT environment.

### Hyper-responsiveness, the ability to go from idea to App immediately:

- Ability to rapidly deliver applications in collaboration with product owners and business user stakeholders increases the PMO’s agility and responsiveness to business and mission needs.

- Ability to expand departmental apps to address enterprise-wide challenges, no matter how large.
