> # **4.0** Low-Code Project Guidance

Using Low-Code to accelerate digital transformation and implement the BES Digital Strategy will impact existing project management processes for developing software. A Low-Code agile adoption team offers an optimal organizational structure for supporting Low-Code application development and delivery.  However, before BES PMOs start looking for the ideal contracting vehicle to engage contractors to work on a Low-Code application development project, they need to have an agile adoption team in place at the outset, one that includes support from the very top to develop the BES Digital Strategy, a champion to keep Low-Code adoption enthusiasm high, and a coach who has experience in Low-Code development platforms, agile development processes, and tools. In this section we will provide project guidance and highlight key success drivers for the Low-Code App Software Development Project Lifecycle. We will discuss:

- 4.2.1 BES Digital Business Strategy
- 4.2.2 Agile Development Practices 
- 4.2.3 Architecture Considerations 
- 4.2.4 DevSecOps Considerations
- 4.2.5 Automated Testing Considerations
- 4.2.6 Cyber Security Considerations (e.g. ATO)
- 4.2.7 Operations Considerations
