> # **4.4** Project Management Processes

As explained in Section 3 - Low-Code Application Development, delivering apps with Low-Code is different from traditional hand-coding. Thus, a different process is needed to help Low-Code agile development teams focus on the right activities and work items at the right time. The Low-Code app development process flow is optimized for delivering business apps, broken down into four activity categories or phases:  Setup, Define Needs, App Delivery, and Run App. These activities and work items are organized with the responsible resources who are consulted for business need requirements and refinement, the resources needed for completing the work item tasks, and who on the project team has final accountability for completion of each activity and work item tasks in the process flow.

## 4.4.1 Agile Enablement
The contractor project team, consisting of the project leadership team and the development team Tech lead, will drive the implementation of innovative solutions that solve complex technical and business issues. The Tech Lead uses an iterative agile methodology (See Section 4.2.1 Agile Development Practices) to establish the connection between business and technical teams and harness the promise cross-functional agile teams can realize on Low-Code App product delivery. 

## 4.4.1 Low-Code Work Item Definitions

Low-Code App development activities or phases and process flow have corresponding activities, work item tasks and roles that can be mapped to a typical agile development practices as described in the **Figure 5** table below.

| Agile Activity Phase | Low-Code Activity Phase | Work Item | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------- | ----------- |

Inevitably, in any discussion about digital transformation or Low-Code platforms, BES management or PMO business user stakeholders will ask, “what’s in it for us?" The best way to answer that question is to demonstrate business value as quickly as possible.  That’s why in the Foundation Stage we recommended starting with a small project to demonstrate how little time it takes for a small agile team to get a working App. After seeing that, the BES PMO is ready to move on to bigger projects.  In addition, key work items, including: App Business Case and Metrics Definition, App Estimation, Mockups – Low and High Fidelity, App Promotion, App Feedback, and Evaluation of Business Case Metrics after production roll out provide valuable insights into the success of the App roll out.
