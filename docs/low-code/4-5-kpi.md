> # **4.5** Key Project Metrics - KPIs

In support of Low-Code Agile development practices, contractor Development Teams will implement a number of DevSecOps Software Quality Assurance metrics as listed in Figure 6 to serve as key performance indicators (KPIs) which provide the PMO and contractor project management oversight.

| DevSecOps Metric                      | Metric Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Deployment Frequency                  | Number of successful deployments to production/iteration.                                                                      |
| Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)          | Time between a failed production deployment to ops restoration.                                                                |
| Time To Patch Vulnerabilities         | Time between identification of a vulnerability in the platform or application and successful production deployment of a patch. |
| Test Coverage                         | Percentage of code that is covered by automated tests.                                                                         |
| Number of Unit/Integration Tests      | Number of automated unit or integration tests for an application.                                                              |
| Number of Functional/Acceptance Tests | Number of automated functional or acceptance tests.                                                                            |
| Coverage of OWASP Benchmark           | % coverage of OWASP Benchmark Cybersecurity Test Cases.                                                                        |
| Deployment Lead Time                  | Time between a favorable security assessment/successful non-production exit to completion of production deployment.            |
| Pipeline-Stage Time                   | Time spent in any given pipeline or pipeline stage.                                                                            |
