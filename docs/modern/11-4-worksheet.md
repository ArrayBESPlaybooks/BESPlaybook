> # **11.4** BPD Tailoring Worksheet for Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase, Production & Deployment Phase, and Operations & Support Phase (24 September, 2018)

_![worksheet](images/worksheet.png)_

For guidance and instruction on the Tailoring Worksheet, refer to the [BPD Tailoring Guide](https://www.dau.mil/cop/bes/DAU%20Sponsored%20Documents/BPD%20Tailoring%20Guide.docx?Web=1).

NOTE: For AAM Agile contract projects, the Agile (Scrum, Kanban, and XP) best practices described in the Agile and AAM Playbooks will replace the BPD IT Lean waterfall centric phases, reviews and documentation.  One of the key AAM contract project assumptions is that the documentation work product artifacts of the legacy system application undergoing modernization and migration to the cloud currently exist, are in accordance with the BPD templates and have been reviewed and approved by the government PMO. If not, only documentation work products agreed to by the application Product Owner will be included in the application release Product Backlog.

When a work product is marked with a checkmark (✔) or asterisk (*), that work product shall either be produced or if it already exists, updated as necessary.  In either case, the work product must be consistent with the current release.  

- ✔ = Product will be or has been produced 
- <span>*</span> = Product will be modified (justification required)
- N/A = Not Applicable (justification required) 

The “JUSTIFICATION FOR TAILORING” column of this template identifies products that shall be tailored out if the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) occurs after Milestone B.  Refer to the BPD Tailoring Guide for conditions regarding when the PDR occurs in relation to Milestone B. 

NOTE: For AAM Agile contract projects, iterative Agile Scrum management practices, XP engineering practices, and product documentation artifacts maintained in the Jira Work Management Tool and Confluence Project Wiki. These work product artifacts will be substituted for the IT Lean reviews and document work product artifacts in the BPD Tailoring Worksheet.

Every product delivered to the customer must have a Peer Review and Minutes.  All meetings and reviews conducted will be formally documented with formal meeting minutes.  Action items identified during meetings and reviews will be tracked to closure.  Refer to the Peer Review Procedure.

NOTE: For AAM Agile contract projects, Agile Product Backlog grooming, iterative Scrum Sprint Backlog Refinement, Sprint Demos, ‘Definition of Done’ criteria, sprint Retrospectives, and Release Integration (Minimum viable Product criteria) review and testing activities of the product user stories and features are performed with the Development Team, Product Owner and Stakeholders. These procedures will replace the BPD Peer Review Procedure. 

### Review Lessons Learned Database

Review the pertinent sections of the Lessons Learned Database.  The database is available for help in avoiding previous pitfalls and for providing ideas that have worked well for others. It can be found on the BPD web site.

### Review Automated Application Modernization (AAM) Playbook

Review the pertinent sections of the AAM Playbook for project guidance in terms of project organization, staffing, management and engineering practices, project phases, work items and deliverables. It can be found on the BES Playbooks web site: [https://besplaybook.github.io/BESPlaybook/](https://besplaybook.github.io/BESPlaybook/).

The following table prescribes work item products that are recommended for an AAM Agile contract project.
