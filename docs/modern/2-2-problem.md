># **2.2** Problem Statement

The AF has many legacy and outdated systems that collectively are comprised of tens of millions of source lines of code (SLOC).  Many of these legacy and outdated systems are on proprietary and “closed” platforms (mainframe and client/server) that prevent functions (business logic) and data contained within them from being readily accessed, integrated or interoperated with, extended or improved.  These systems contain valuable, business-critical logic and data that drive the AF and support numerous missions.  This functionality needs to be unlocked so it can be used in conjunction with the other AF applications to improve business and mission effectiveness.  Other issues with the AF’s legacy applications and systems include: poor cyber posture, current platform and language limitations, poor user experiences and user interfaces, poor performance, difficult to find labor skills for legacy technologies, expensive hosting platforms and difficult to modernize.
