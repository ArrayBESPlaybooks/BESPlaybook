># **2.3** Purpose

This AAM Playbook Chapter is a continuation of effort by the BES PEO to establish modern practices and methods to accelerate software development and deployment of value for Logistics Information Systems, Business Systems and its end users.  Preceded by playbooks for Agile and Automated Testing, and User Experience, this playbook aims to provide approaches, methods, and tools to apply automation to efficiently modernize legacy applications.

Once legacy applications are modernized to the AF standard, the value of the business logic and data can be much more easily be shared with other applications increasing the completeness and accuracy of information and, ultimately, improving mission effectiveness.
