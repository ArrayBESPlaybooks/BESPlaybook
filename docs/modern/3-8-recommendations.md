> # **3.8** Recommendations

- Ensure AF senior stakeholders agree on the applicationâ€™s future.  This should be an outcome of the AF domain portfolio application rationalization assessment process.
- Ensure AF senior stakeholders agree on the required (and desired) outcomes for the modernization project.  Ensure this is clearly and concisely documented and communicated to stakeholders.
- Ensure the application baseline is accurately documented.  It is best to use an auto discovery tool against the existing production application to create a model of the application.  At a minimum, ensure the application code, database, interfaces, network constructs, and cyber/identity and access management mechanisms are documented and understood.
