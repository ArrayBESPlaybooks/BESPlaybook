> # **5.3** Technical Management Processes

The Technical Management processes are concerned with managing the resources and assets allocated by organization management and with applying them to fulfill the agreements into which the organization or organizations enter. The Technical Management processes relate to the technical effort of projects, in particular to project planning in terms of cost, schedule and outcome achievements, to the assessment of actions to help ensure that they comply with plans and performance criteria and to the identification and selection of corrective actions that recover shortfalls in progress and achievement. These processes are used to establish and perform technical plans for the project, manage information across the technical team, assess technical progress against the plans for the software system, products, or services, control technical tasks through to completion, and aid in decision‐making.

NOTE 1: Technical management is ‘the application of technical and administrative resources to plan, organize and control engineering functions’. Typically, several projects will co‐exist in any one organization. The Technical Management processes can be employed at a corporate level to meet internal needs. **Figure 5-1** lists the processes contained in this process group. NOTE 2: Technical Management processes are applied during the performance of each Technical process.
