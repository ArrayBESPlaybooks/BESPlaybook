> # **5.4** Technical processes

The Technical processes are concerned with technical actions throughout the life cycle. Technical processes transform the needs of stakeholders into a product or service. By applying that product or operating that service, technical processes, provide sustainable performance, when and where needed in order to meet the stakeholder requirements and achieve customer satisfaction. The Technical processes are applied in order to create and use a software system, whether it is in the form of a model or is an operational product. The Technical processes apply at any level in a hierarchy of software system structure and at any stage in the life cycle. **Figure 5-1** lists the processes contained in this process group.
