**Figure 9.1. Proposed Service Desk SLA Metrics (Tier 2 and 3).**


We recommend the Service Desk tool be configured to provide critical incident management notification and workflows to manage a critical incident; for example, an App release failure into production – an event which disrupts one or more App services. We recommend standardizing incident status and reporting mechanisms via a Service Desk tool Dashboard based on the KPIs in **Figure 9-1**. The tool’s Applications Dashboard will enable PMO development and sustainment contractor project teams to manage, monitor, coordinate and communicate status of application performance to PMO stakeholders in a centralized, government-approved format.
