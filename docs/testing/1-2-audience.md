This playbook is intended for those individuals responsible for the management and engineering of test automation. It provides managers with the knowledge 
that will help them support programs looking to implement automation and it will provide engineers with the information they will need to successfully plan 
the implementation of a test automation solution. The approach is holistic in that it broadly defines many factors, not just technical ones, that are 
necessary to understand and apply when moving towards automation.
