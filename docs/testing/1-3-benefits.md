> # 1.3 Benefits of Automated Testing

An investment in automation can reap many rewards to the test team and overall project. There are primary and secondary benefits to using automated tools.

### Primary Benefits

The primary benefits to using automation for testing can be summarized as follows:

- Faster test execution
- More reliable/repeatable test execution
- Increased quality from greater test coverage due to additional tests
- Facilitates testing of more complex scenarios
- Less error-prone than manual testing
- More consistent than manual testing
- Provides for unattended 24/7 test execution
- Ability to create additional test conditions from single script
- Reusability of tests within and across test events
- Ability to test more in the same or shorter time schedule
- Testing across a variety of software/hardware platforms
- Allows for the possibility of testing that which could not be tested manually
- Allows for increased frequency of testing
- Allows more effective use of testing resources (i.e. more test design, less manual execution)

### Secondary Benefits

Secondary benefits for using automated test tools consist of support activities for testing, rather than the testing itself. These include:

- User account creation in advance of testing
- Database seeding with required test data
- Creation/management of test datasets
- Test environment configuration setup
- Pre-test initialization activities
- Post-test clean-up activities
- Automated data analysis of concluded test events

### Project and Program Benefits

The use of automation brings benefits beyond testing to the project and program. These include:

- Improved software quality
- Earlier defect detection
- Fewer defects sent to next testing phase
- Greater efficiency in accomplishing testing
- Greater relevance of timely test results
- Reduced risk of deployment
- Improved test reporting 
- Facilitated identification of defect root causes 
- Reduced test execution cost
- Shortened test execution period
- Improved consistency of test executions
- Better adapted to iterative development where more frequent testing is required
- Improved feedback related to application quality
- Improved system reliability through repeatability and consistency of tests
