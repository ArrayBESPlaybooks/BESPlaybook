> # **10.4** Making the Process Repeatable

Ultimately, we want to learn from our efforts and know that we can do this again for the next project. Repeatability of the process requires a sound overall design, 
clear implementation, and useful documentation. As the automation evolves, all aspects of its design need to be understood and documented so that as testers are 
rotated into and out of a program there is a permanence to the automation that was built.
