> # **2.1** What is Automation?

Automation, in its simplest form, is the mechanization of a manual process that allows for that process to operate automatically. There are many applications 
of automation, and there are many ways in which we can test. Using automation allows us to mechanize an otherwise manual process for testing. There are many 
additional uses for automation, that are not specifically for testing, that can be performed with automated test tools. Examples of these may include pre-test 
activities such as creating user accounts and building data sets, which will ultimately be used in automated testing. Functional and regression test activities 
are those most  frequently targeted for the use of automated testing. Additional uses for automation of tests include API testing, performance testing, security 
testing, and automation of test management activities.
