> # **2.2** Automation in Software Lifecycle Methodologies

Software development methodologies are evolving from traditional Waterfall to more recent Agile approaches. Testing is part of the overall software development 
process. When implementing testing automation, it must align with and conform to the project management methodology. In projects using Waterfall project management, 
cycles for development are long and the automation team can plan accordingly. This would include setting up many of the functions and components and building an 
automation framework. With Agile projects, there isn't as much time within each sprint to build out a complete automation framework so alternate solutions should 
be identified.
