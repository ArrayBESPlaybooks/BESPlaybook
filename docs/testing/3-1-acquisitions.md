> # **3.1** Acquisitions

Automated testing is an integral part of modern software development. As such, requirements for automated testing should be identified in the requirement 
document (e.g., Statement of Objective or Statement of Work). It is essential to establish best practices as requirements at the onset of all new software 
acquisitions, not only to ensure they are delivered during execution, but to ensure quality vendors respond. The DoD 5000 already prescribes such requirements. 
Specifically, DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02 defines, under DT&E Planning Considerations, the requirement to "develop a software test automation strategy" 
and under OT&E for software, for regression tests to be "preferably automated." This policy, now superseded by policy 5000.75 for business systems and 
implemented with AFMAN 63-144, includes a directive to "Employ  effective  use  of  integrated  testing  and  automated  software  test  tools."

Acquisition guidelines should be stated at the objective level, however, they should allow for the ability for the contractor to recommend industry best 
testing tools that may be implemented with Government approval. The goal is to obtain the best solution for the program and the Government. Many contracting 
organizations with automation skills have honed the techniques necessary to deliver quality, reliable automated test solutions.

If it is envisioned that government will take over the use and management of the automated testing suite, guidelines for training and transitioning of 
the solution should be required as part of the Statement of Objective or Statement of Work. If a different technology is envisioned for any continuation 
of test automation, then the test data used to drive the automation should be delivered in a standardized manner that allows for reusability and adaptability 
to another automated solution.
